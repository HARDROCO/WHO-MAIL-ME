# User guide to create a use the mboxfile

### **1. Pre-procesing data ('mbox file'):**
	The gathering file only works with .txt files with a defined structure as detailed below,
	you can see and example of it in the "Input" folder:
 
#### **1.1. mbox file :** 
   Download the .mbox file through your gmail account following the instructions in the link: 
      
   + Download mbox file : https://takeout.google.com
      
   Google will download the data of your mail from the beginning of time in a file type "filename.mbox".
   The file can weigh several GB so it is necessary to convert it to plain text and thus avoid the 
   unnecessary use of memory when processing the data, leaving a file of just MB    easily manipulated

#### **1.2. From a .mbox to.txt file :**
   to convert the file, use the ´´mbox-viewer´´ program, a powerful tool that is extremely fast and easy to use.
   you can download it from its repository and thank the author.

   Once `mbox-viewer` was installed, read the user guide and do what you have to do with all your emails,
   the important thing to use `WMMP` is that the emails that you are going to export to txt have a date 
   and where they are from. to avoid errors with text scraping once you have selected the mails to export
   convert to txt according to the user guide and that's it, the program will give you a .txt file with
   the correct structure to use `WMMP`
