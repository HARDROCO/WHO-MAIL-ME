#   (WMM) WHO MAIL ME PROJECT

The project uses a simple group of Python scripts, creates a text scrape from an MBOX file
from a Gmail account to analyze data, to produce visualizations and reports if you need them
to add to your data science projects.

## How does it work?
The program follows a structure to produce the correct results
 * Chose a mbox file and convert it to a plain text mbox.txt (Read pre-procesing data file )
 * WMM_gather.py file it gather the information from mbox.txt creates a SQL database and clean the data
 * WMM_visual.py file it reads the database and produce graphs to analyse them
 
This is the beta phase and there are many things to improve that could be added to the script,
feel free to contribute if you wish
