The project use a simple group of Python scripts, make text scraping of a MBOX file from a Gmail account to analyse data,
to produce visualizations and reports if you need add to your projects of Data Sciene.

## How does it work?
The program follows a structure to produce the correct results
 * Chose a mbox file and convert it to a plain text mbox.txt (Read pre-procesing data file )
 * WMM_gather.py file it gather the information from mbox.txt creates a SQL database and clean the data
 * WMM_visual.py file it reads the database and produce graphs to analyse them
